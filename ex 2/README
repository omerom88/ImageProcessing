	- convDerivative.m - Computes the magnitude of image derivatives.
	- fourierDerivative.m - Computes the magnitude of image derivatives using fourier transform.
	- blurInImageSpace.m - Performs image blurring using 2D convolution between an image and a gaussian kernel.
	- blurInFourierSpace.m - Performs image blurring using 2D convolution between an image and a gaussian kernel in fourier space.
	- buildGaussianMask.m - building a gausian filter
- Question from section 2:
	1. The difference of the magnitude come from the fact that derivation in image space is discrete and 
	   therefore approximation, which means we "losing" values. The derivation in freq. space is continuous 
	   and more accurate. For that reason the derivation is different, and the magnitudes as well.
- Question from section 3:
	1. The reason we need to shift to the center, is when we perform the operations (in that case convolution) 
	   with two signals, we need them to be located in the same spot. If the mask center are
	   not in (0,0) we won't get the result that we want from the filter, which means we'll trasform the wrong 
	   mask, and filtering the wrong frequencies.
	2. Like we learned in class, fourier transform of gaussian function is gaussian, but with an inverse variance.
	   it means that if the original mask was narrow the mask after fourier will be wide, and vice versa.
	   And as we know by now, convolution of a given image with wide gaussian mask, and convolution with
	   narrow mask will give a different results.
