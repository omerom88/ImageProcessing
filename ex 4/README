- comments:
while i worked on my panorams i find out that my function from ex3 are not perfect, 
so i added some conditions to fit the dimintions of my images (in ex3 we assumed 
that the sizes of the input are ^2)furthermore, i understand from Inbar that 
youll check the code with your GaussianPyramid and LaplacianPyramid so i hope 
you would not take more points off, on that part. Just asking that youll change the
parameters that pyramidBlending gets accordinly (now its 2,5,5 but im prety sure it need
to be 7,11,8 with good pyramids).
Thank you for understandin.
